# Project Partners
University of the Philippines Los Baños
UPLB is the primary beneficiary of the project, and the project milestones align well with UPLB's needs to further advance its capabilities in omics and bioinformatics research. The PhD and MS scholars engaged in the project are either UPLB faculty and research staff, or UPLB alumni, and will return to the university once their graduate studies are completed, to conduct research in the newly constructed AGRC. 

As the premiere national university for agriculture, UPLB is at the forefront of advanced research in agriculture and has been adopting advanced molecular biology, biotechnology, and omics technologies for numerous research projects. Multiple institutes from two colleges, as well as research center(s) are scientific partners in the AGRC project, including:

Philippine Genome Center - Agriculture

Institute of Biological Science - College of Arts and Science

Institute of Computer Science - College of Arts and Science

Institute of Crop Science - College of Agriculture and Food Science
